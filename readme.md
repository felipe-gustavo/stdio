After a very long time, finally version 2 is here. The cool `stdio` module you cannot live without has been rewritten and improved a lot, with Typescript support, promise-based usage and much more.

> **Note**: Version 2 is not compatible with previous versions, so you'll need to read this documentation carefully before upgrading.
