After a very long time, finally version 2 is here. The cool `stdio` module you cannot live without has been rewritten and improved a lot, with Typescript support, promise-based usage and much more.

**Note**: Version 2 stops supporting non promise-based usage, so it is not compatible with older versions. If you're using an older version of `stdio` please, read this documentation carefully before upgrading.
